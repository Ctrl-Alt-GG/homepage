## Will there be internet access?

Yes, there will be. But regardless, we ask that you download the games you want to play at home beforehand! Also, make sure to update your operating system before the event. It would be embarrassing if you had to watch the loading screen while everyone else is playing.

## Why do we have to pay for this?

Unfortunately, we have to pay for certain assets, like the venue. We split this cost fairly among everyone.

## Will there be food provided?

No. Basically, it's up to everyone to figure out their own meals.

If there's interest, we can pool money together and order pizzas or something similar. We'll figure that out at the venue.

## Will there be any refreshments provided?

Since we have access to a fridge, of course there will be cold beer and soft drinks at cost. We'll also provide snacks in limited quantities, so the left mouse button stays nice and greasy.

## Will these be the only games?

Definitely not! First, you could (and still can) suggest games on Discord in the #general channel. We take these seriously, and if we can make them work, we probably will.

Second, if you and a few friends want to play a game we didn't think of, nobody's going to stop you.

## I want to go, but I don't know how to get my computer there...

Unfortunately, we organizers might not be able to help directly. But if you have this kind of problem, definitely mention it to the other participants! Trust in the power of community! There will surely be someone who can help you in some way. Feel free to bring it up on Discord, you'll definitely find each other!

## Where can I sleep?

You can sleep wherever you can find a suitable spot for yourself, but keep in mind that life goes on around you. Of course, the city won't be far enough that you couldn't slip away for a quick power nap. ;)

Be sure to bring your **gaming computer** – the one you want to use to game with your gamer buddies like the real gamers you are. It can be a desktop or a laptop. The key is that you're responsible for getting it there and back.

Whatever you do, don't forget the **power cable or charger** for your computer! If your machine comes with additional components (like a monitor for a desktop), bring a power strip too! And if your computer doesn't have an ethernet port, make sure to bring an appropriate **adapter**!

Of course, don't forget the associated peripherals and accessories like mouse, keyboard, mousepad, headphones, etc.

What you DON'T need is a network (UTP) cable. We'll provide that for everyone. You'll also have chairs and tables at your disposal (hopefully).

And definitely don't bring a UPS!

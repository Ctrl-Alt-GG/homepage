### What to bring and what not to

Bring your **gaming PC** - the one you want to game on with your gamer friends like a true gamer. It can be a desktop or a laptop. You're responsible for getting it to and from the venue.

Don't forget the **power cable or charger** for your machine. If your setup includes extra gear (for a desktop, for example, a monitor), bring a **power strip**. If your computer lacks an Ethernet port, make sure to bring the right **adapter** — Wi-Fi is primarily intended for mobile devices and web browsing.

Also bring your peripherals and accessories: mouse, keyboard, mousepad, **headset**, etc. Please do not bring speakers, but don't leave your microphone at home.

You **do not** need to bring a network (UTP) cable — we'll provide those for everyone. Chairs and tables will also be available. Because of the layout we can offer at most up to **two power outlets per person**, so if you need multiple devices, bring a power strip.

Seating is **first come, first served**, so early arrivals have more choice. If you have special needs (for example, a special chair due to back problems), let us know in advance.

And under no circumstances bring a **UPS**.

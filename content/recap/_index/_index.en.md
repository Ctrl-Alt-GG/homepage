title: "Highlights from Last Time"

At the first Ctrl-Alt-GG event, we met downtown to spend an awesome Saturday together.

What most participants were looking forward to was the authentic Counter-Strike tournament experience. Given the number of attendees, two teams were organized on-site to compete against each other. The tension grew after each round. The concentration and adrenaline were almost tangible in the room. In the end, the two teams couldn't decide the outcome: after three matches, it ended in a draw.

While guns were firing in most of the room, Minecraft enthusiasts were creating in their own world. In a relatively short time, they made significant progress in the game. Their creativity was commendable.

At the end of the day, Garry's Mod Prop Hunt made everyone laugh. It was incredibly funny watching someone try to disguise themselves as a chair or refrigerator while others ran around the map as canned goods, drawing the entire seeker team's attention. Unexpected discoveries and creative hiding spots provided continuous entertainment.

Of course, a shared pizza order was essential for good vibes and the authentic LAN party experience. Participants quenched their thirst with soft drinks and beer. The friendly atmosphere ensured everyone had a great time, and we're already looking forward to the next opportunity...

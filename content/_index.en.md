Ready for the biggest gaming event of the year, the ultimate LAN party where everyone who matters will be there? Well, this isn't that. But don't worry, you matter to us. <3

That's why we're inviting you to the best, most incredible, grassroots gaming event of the year – for the second time – because the first one was such a huge success that there was no question about doing it again. Our goal this time is simple: to spend a weekend together with like-minded folks, enjoying our favorite games – and beer. Along the way, we'll be obsessively working to set up the best network we can, because we know that good vibes are built on low ping. And who knows... if the gaming tournament kicks off, maybe a couple of surprise prizes will find new owners.

## Venue

**Biatorbágy-Tópart Office Building** - Modern, comfortable office environment at very reasonable rates. The entire office will be ours, kitchen included.

## Meet...

### FiNT

I'm FiNT with nearly 20 years of Counter-Strike experience (though it doesn't really show in my skill level). I've played all generations of the game, had my own clan, managed servers, and built communities. I follow the competitive scene too, always have a Twitch stream running in the background. Besides shooting, I love racing games – Trackmania is a favorite, and I used to compete in the Dirt series.

❤️: CS2, Satisfactory, GTA5

### Marcsello

My name is Marcsello and for as long as I can remember, I've been interested in computers, but especially networked computers and everything you can do with them – like play games on them.
I first got to know Counter-Strike in middle school and played a lot of 1.6, had my own clan and server for a while. After a longer break, I came back with Global Offensive at a local LAN Party. During the day I work as a software developer, and after work it's become a regular thing to take a shot with the guys on cs_office: no skill, just fun. My eternal favorites are Garry's Mod and everything in the Half-Life franchise.

Due to my insatiable curiosity about IT, I have a lot of small hobby projects that often steal time from actual gaming. One of them is figuring out how to design, build, and operate the entire IT infrastructure of a LAN Party.

### TormaKris

I'm Kristóf and I've been playing various video games since kindergarten, with Counter-Strike being one of the first. Of course, a lot of time has passed since then, and I don't have as much time to play as I'd like, and when I do I prefer console games. The atmosphere of LAN parties always got to me, so the idea came up to organize one. Besides that, I'm active as a radio amateur, and when I'm not spending my free time on that, it's mostly the world of technology and IT that captivates me. I originally worked as a DevOps engineer, which is the field closest to my heart, but for the past year I've been helping my team as a scrum master in our daily work.

I'm a sci-fi fanatic – Star Trek, Stargate, Battlestar Galactica – I can watch these nonstop.

### and Bence

Back when I was very young, I drove my computer science teacher crazy by playing Counter-Strike 1.6 instead of paying attention in class. Over the years I've been part of many different gaming communities where I've met a lot of great people. I got here because the guys said let's organize a LAN party, and I said okay. I'm the team's lucky charm. My presence brings luck and sometimes I even do some design work. (by the way, can I be listed first?)
